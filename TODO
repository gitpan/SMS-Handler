This is the "rolling" TODO file. Entries beginning with a '-' are
pending. Entries beginning with 'X' are done but pending release.

*** Email.pm: 

- Need a command to fetch headers of n messages

- Macros that substitute themselves by commonly used text in the
  messages.

- Create a .OPTIONS command to control other aspects of the
  applications. .INTERFACE should become a sub-command.

- .CHECK must be revisited, sp its messages.
